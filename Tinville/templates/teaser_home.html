                Hello everyone and welcome to Tinville! Well, our soon-to-be, currently under-construction site. Or
                as we like to to think of it, our "awaiting perfection site.”
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                You see, Tinville is a marketplace where designers, whether established or just starting off, can sell
                their one of a kind items to the world. For example, if you're looking for that perfect dress that no one
                else will be wearing to the party, Tinville will have it. If you're looking for a wardrobe change for the
                start of the semester, Tinville can help. While if you're looking for a site for a village made out of tin
                or simply looking to buy dolphins on the black market, Tinville wont have it. Got it? Pretty cool huh?
